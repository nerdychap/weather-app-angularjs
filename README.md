# weather-app-angularjs

Weather App that I developed using AngularJS. It uses the Angular HTTP service to send requests, geolocation API to get the current location of the user and the openweathermap API to get weather forecast. The web application gives you the current weather forecast at current location on start up and lets you enter any area which you want to check the weather of. There is also a designated button to get the weather at current location. I used HTML, CSS to style the application and AngularJS(Javascript) as the framework.
